### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Diego Bartoli Geijo, 24 years old, from Trieste, Italy. 

I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from the UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Trieste and a master degree in Data Science from the UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano Bicocca.
I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the Radboud University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. 

After building a strong foundation in the necessary mathematical and computer science principles during my bachelor degree, I focused on Data Science, attracted by the countless ways in which data can become a valuable asset for companies and contribute to the development of society. 

I am of Italian and Spanish nationality, so I speak both languages as a native speaker, and I am fluent in English, having used it for work during six months in Amsterdam, apart from the Erasmus experience.
I am also starting to learn Portuguese. 

Outside of my studies, my main passions are football, which I played for 14 years, writing and the world of multimedia communication. 

I hope you find my repos interesting and feel free to contact me with any questions you may have!
