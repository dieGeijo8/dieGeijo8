### Hi there 👋

I am Diego Bartoli Geijo, 24 years old, from Trieste, Italy 🏡.

I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from the Università degli Studi di Trieste and a master degree in Data Science from the Università degli Studi di Milano Bicocca 💻🧮.
I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the Radboud University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands 📝. 

I am of Italian and Spanish nationality, so I speak both languages as a native speaker, and I am fluent in English, having used it for work during six months in Amsterdam, apart from the Erasmus experience.
I am also starting to learn Portuguese 🌎. 

Outside of my studies, my main passions are football, which I played for 14 years, writing and the world of multimedia communication⚽. 

I hope you find my repos interesting and feel free to contact me with any questions you may have! 👌
